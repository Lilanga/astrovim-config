This repository contains my personal configurations for Neovim + Astrovim
Plugins expect Lazy pluin manager

## Installation

1. Backup your current configuration

   ```bash
    mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
   ```

2. Clone Astrovim if you haven't already done so

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim ~/.config/nvim
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your home directory

    ```

## OS / Environment tested

This configuration has been tested on MacOS and Linux. It should work on Windows as well, but I haven't tested it. I am using different user configurations for my windows workstation.

Currently using with Neovim 0.10.0

## Screenshots

Following are screenshots of the applied NVIM configuration. I am using Iterm2 with semi transparent background settings. The font used is Fira Code.
